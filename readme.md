# The Tower of Windsock

## What is this

That is a space when I`ll make some [☣ - experiences](WIP) or create little articles, talking about things I love like [λ - Functional programming](WIP).

## How I make it

Before I need tell a little history because I chose this stack.  
Once upon a time a magic software builder called Microsoft created a magic artifact called [Microsoft interact](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/). The artifact holder have a big power of... make same stuff than jupyter notebook with little advantages like the communication between different languages in same notebook and VS Code facilities, but I preferred use some magic artifacts already works, [Jupyter lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#), than use another is on preview version and not works so well.

Microsoft Interact is a cool tool I use for some proof of concept or test some complex logic, because you don't need mess of folder or any fsproj/csproj just write and run, but have problems like is hard to share because .Net environment is so heavy or VS Code insiders instability, so because this problems I chose jupyter notebook.  
Wait a second, but to use jupyter notebook you still need a environment, how to share the code without local environment?  
So another magic artifact Docker.
