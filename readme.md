## What is this? 
Here when I will make my ☣ experiences using a Microsoft [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) solution [.NET Interactive Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-interactive-preview-3-vs-code-insiders-and-polyglot-notebooks/).  
This is a Polyglot Notebooks solution like [Jupter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) but using F# and C# kernels and integrated with [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/). Now you can test new ideas and share without a mess of folders or wait a long time to compile the solution.

Install now following:
* [VS Code insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)
* [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) 

## How to use? 
1. Read this [.NET Interactive Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-interactive-preview-3-vs-code-insiders-and-polyglot-notebooks/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Enjoy    ͡° ͜ʖ  ͡°.
